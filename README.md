# Extended Kalman Filter-Based Estimator and Controller

This project develops an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based estimator that learns the human gait-state (phase, phase rate, stride length, ground inclination) using the sensors onboard the [Dephy](https://www.dephy.com/) ExoBoot. 



This work is performed under the [Neurobionics Laboratory](https://neurobionics.robotics.umich.edu/) and the [Locomotor Control Systems Laboratory](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/locolab/) under Drs. Elliott Rouse, Robert Gregg, and Gray Thomas.
